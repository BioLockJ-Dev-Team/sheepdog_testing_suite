AWS test collection

NOT EXECUTABLE
Not machine-readable, its human-readable. 

For aws tests, we should run one test at a time.
We don't have a way (yet) for bash to know if/when a pipeline is complete.
Thus, this is not an executable script like the other run_*_testSets,
it is instructions for a human about what commands to run
with the idea that some smart human will also be looking at the 
aws console and signing in to the ec2 head node 
to see that the tests complete.
This will get more automated as features progress.

# Run the following commands ... smartly.

biolockj --aws ${SHEP}/test/module/email/email.properties

biolockj --aws ${SHEP}/test/module/assembly/test_assembly_aws.properties

biolockj --aws ${SHEP}/test/aws/aws_RdpPipeline.properties
