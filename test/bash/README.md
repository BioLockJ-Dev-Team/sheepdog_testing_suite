# Test bash layer

The tests in this folder test code that executes between the point when the user calls `biolockj` and the point when the `BioLockJ` java program launches.

The tests in `testCommandLine.sh` do not actually run a pipeline.  They make use of the `BIOLOCKJ_TEST_MODE` variable to make the bash program exit before actually launching a pipeline.  The tests in `basicRealTest.sh` and `testRestartCylce.sh` launch very slim pipelines, just enough to make sure that the bash scripts can actually launch a pipeline. All are built to be very fast so a developer can run them after making each minimal change.

The `wrap_bash_tests.sh` script will save the results to a file and note the latest git commit for both sheepdog and BioLockJ, making it easier to see how far back the last passing tests were.
<br>Usage: `wrap_bash_tests.sh testCommandLine.sh`

The `run_bash_testCollection.sh` script (in $SHEP/test) runs all of the bash test scripts, using `wrap_bash_tests.sh` on each of them, and reports which (if any) failed.

### Update tests

Git is set to ignore new files in `expected`.  To add new ones, you will need to use `git add -f <filename>`.  Anytime you modifiy a file that is already checked in, git will notice automatically.  For any files you add that have computer-specific file paths or the date anywhere in them, you should only commit the `_generic.out` file that is generated by running the `generalize.sh` script.
