## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Access the earlier pipeline outputs

The metadata is in the output folder of the "ImportMetadata" module.
```{r}
pipeRoot="../.."
metaModule=dir(path=pipeRoot, pattern="ImportMetadata", full.names = TRUE, include.dirs = TRUE)
metaDir=dir(path=metaModule, pattern="output", full.names = TRUE, include.dirs = TRUE)
metaFile=dir(path=metaDir, full.names = TRUE, include.dirs = FALSE)
meta = read.table(metaFile, header=TRUE, row.names = 1)
metaFile
meta
```

The counts tables that have been normalized and log-scaled are in the "LogTransformTaxaTables" module.
```{r}
countsMod=dir(path=pipeRoot, pattern="LogTransformTaxaTables", full.names = TRUE, include.dirs = TRUE)
countsDir=dir(path=countsMod, pattern="output", full.names = TRUE, include.dirs = TRUE)
file=dir(path=countsDir, pattern="phylum.tsv", full.names = TRUE, include.dirs = FALSE)
file
```

Now you can use this information in customized ways, as appropriate for a specific project.
```{r}
level = gsub("[^?]*_taxaCount_norm_Log10_|.tsv", "", file)
table = read.table(file,
                   header = TRUE,
                   row.names = 1,
                   sep = "\t")
merged = merge(meta, table, by = 0)
sp = split(merged[names(table)], f=merged$Location)
df = sapply(sp, colMeans)
plot(df, main = "Mean normalized counts", pch=19, xlim=c(0,max(df)), ylim=c(0,max(df)))
abline(0,1)
text(df, labels=row.names(df), pos=4, xpd=TRUE)
```



## Including Images

When rendering the output to html, you can use standard html to insert images as part of your document.

<img src="sheep_mocha.jpg" alt="a pre-existing plot or image">

``r readLines("photoCredit.txt")``
