# README

For each environment, we need to run a complete set of full pipelines.
The folders for aws, cluster, docker and local contain full pipelines.
These are run routinely to quickly show that no problems have been introduced.

The module folder holds tests designed to get a comprehensive view of a single module or utility.  These are only created/used when developing or troubleshooting a particular module or utility and are not run routinely.
