# README

For each environment, we need to run a complete set of full pipelines.
The folders for aws, cluster, docker and local contain full pipelines.
These are run routinely to quickly show that no problems have been introduced.

The module folder holds tests designed to get a comprehensive view of a single module or utility.  These are only created/used when developing or troubleshooting a particular module or utility and may not be routinely.

The bash folder holds tests designed to make sure the bash layer is passing information correctly. It tests code that executes between the point when the user calls `biolockj` and the point when the BioLockJ java program launches.
