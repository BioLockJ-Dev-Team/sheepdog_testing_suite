In 02, a file was removed from the expectations.  The validation util fails that output file, but the pipeline is rigged to not stop.  

In 03, check files module validates that the correct pass/fail assignments happened in 02.

In 04, there is a made-up expected file. The pipeline should fail when that the validator says that file is missing.
