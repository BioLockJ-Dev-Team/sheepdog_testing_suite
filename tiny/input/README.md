# Tiny Input

Directories used as inputs for BioLockJ test pipelines.

The file structure under this directory matches the file structure under the top level sheepdog_testing_suite/input folder.

UNLIKE the top level input directory, these are tiner than toys.  
The sequence files are generally 10 reads or less.  Grossly unrealistic, these are just enough to test the plumbing--and test it quickly!
