# pipelines

**Keep this empty.**

BioLockJ pipelines are designed to be a lasting record of an analysis and they are saved under `$BLJ_PROJ`.

In contrast, _test_ pipelines are designed to be created and destroyed in rapid-fire.

With that in mind, this directory is **_automatically emptied_** when RunMockMain runs a test set.
