# Verification Tests

Tests that have hard-coded scipts to verify the results.

These are sanity checks to help us ensure that the results we produce are correct.

For example: 
If was run RDP worked correctly, then every read that it reports as classified from a particular sample should be found in the sequence file for that sample.
